# Mealbot

Mealbot is a weekly meal plan and grocery list generator. It saves your time searching for recipes, creates a menu that doesn't repeat, and also cuts down on grocery waste.

This project was created in a week and a half by [Grace Wang](https://github.com/GraceWXT), [Lucas Tan](https://github.com/lucasxtan), and [Warren Roque](https://github.com/wawwen1) as the final project of Lighthouse Labs Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
